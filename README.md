This sprint went pretty well overall. We built the Airline API and the CLI client as two separate projects, following the requirements. The API included all the main layers — model, repository, service, and controller — and the CLI was set up to make GET requests to answer the four required questions.

What went well:
The structure of the API came together smoothly once we understood how the layers connected. We were happy with how the controller and service worked together, and it was satisfying to get the CLI communicating with the API properly.

What was challenging:
Setting up Maven and making sure IntelliJ was configured correctly took some time. We also had to troubleshoot GitHub connections and workflow setup before everything ran smoothly.

What we could improve:
Next time, we’d like to focus more on testing

Overall:
This sprint helped us understand how APIs and clients communicate and gave us hands-on experience organizing full Java projects. There were a few challenges, but we learned a lot from the process.
